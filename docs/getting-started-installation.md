## Quick start
To get the latest version of quicksi


```
npx quicksi
```


> If you've previously installed quicksi globally via npm install -g quicksi, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g quicksi to ensure that npx always uses the latest version. Or see the other installations below if you want to install globally.


## Install globally
To install `quicksi` on your local machine, run:

```
npm i -g quicksi
```
or

```
yarn global add quicksi
```

<br/>
Installing quicksi globally gives you access to one command alone:

```
quicksi
```

<br/>
But you'll have to check for new versions of quicksi and update the package.

```
npm update -g quicksi
```

***Note: Due to several updates on dependencies, some dependencies might be using the old version. Kindly update them after they've been generated, before use, or raise a bug-fix to update the dependencies. Quicksi maintainer updates and merge in new features including the ones from contributors every weekend, and will try as much as possible to update the dependencies with older versions as well.***

***In case there is an issue while trying to generate your starter, kindly raise an issue or a bug-fix.***
