![Introducing Quicksi](/img/quicksi.png)

We are very happy to introduce [Quicksi](https://github.com/AnayoOleru/quicksi) an open source command line tool designed to make it easy for developers to start projects without having to worry about the setup.

Quicksi was created for the following reasons:

### Helping developers stay productive
Creating a project time to time is something many developers go through. Most time these projects have the same installation and setup, and that means recalling what was done in the previous project. That is bothering. Many times it's even thinking about going through the stress of installation that gets developers so discouraged. But aside from that setting up a project on it's own takes some amount of time. That shouldn't be.

As technology improves, so should the method of developing them be improved too. And that's how Quicksi was born. Quicksi contains several reuseable starters in different languages, their frameworks or libraries and comes in different form, helping developers stay productive. This starters are already setup and developers don't need to be concerned about setup anymore but adding the features or value immediately to their project.

One thing that also makes `quicksi` stand out, is it's command-line interface, with Quicksi, you generate all your starters automatically install their dependencies right from your command-line. Like every CLI the command is short and very easy to
understand.


### Easy access the `starters` of speakers
Most tech conferences or workshops, online or offline, video tutorials or written tutorials or coding school, with a mixed audience of different skills and levels, most times they start by creating a starter on any version control services for people to clone and follow up as they code out a solution.

Many developers has been lost in this process and couldn't follow up due of one issue or another, could be no poor experience using the version control service, or cloning the repository to their machine doesn't ever work. Or some before they could get everything up and running the speaker must have gone too far to catch up with.

Speakers can't wait for everyone on the audience to setup their starters before proceeding. But with Quicksi, students can easily setup their starters through their terminal easily, without having to go through those process. On the `tutorial` section of Quicksi documentation, contain these starters for the tutorials people create:

1. Speakers contributes their starter on quicksi and give it a unique 3 number code.
***Learn how to contribute a tutorial starter [here](https://github.com/AnayoOleru/quicksi/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

2. Students run quicksi command, select `tutorial` and input the unique 3 number code created and sent from the speaker.

3. And that's it, starter will be generated and if there are dependencies, they'll be installed automatically.
